    "# HoMM III moster duel simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tool for measuring combat performance of creatures in HoMM III. The in-game AI Values are a good estimation of the unit's real strength, but they are global, which means there is only a single value to describe the quality of creature $A$ against both creatures $B$ and $C$, which can be vastly different. For example, when a Mighty Gorgon takes on a stack of Pixies, its death stare ability is almost useless, because a Pixie has a very low HP. However, in a fight between Mighty Gorgons and Azure Dragons, the Gorgons' special power is invaluable. This can't be captured by assigning only one fixed number to each monster. Mighty Gorgons vs Azure Dragons is probably the best example, but there are many more like it, albeit less extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made a simplified (but equivalent) version of Heroes III combat engine, which allowed me to do fast duel simulations between every single pair of units. That gave me lot of numbers describing how any given unit performs in a direct confrontation against every other unit in HoMM III.\n",

    "Some caveats:\n",
    "* it's a duel: a single stack of unit $A$ fights vs a single stack of unit $B$\n",
    "* no heroes or terrain modifiers, units use their base stats\n",
    "* not every special ability got implemented, but a vast majority of them did, see the Combat Rules section\n",

    "\n",

    "## Unit value\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a subset of monsters $S$ and a creature $A$ we can try to calculate something similar to AI Value, but representing the effectiveness of $A$ specifically against $S$. This gives us the possibility to measure the quality of a certain unit against only units of higher level, or against one specific town. That quality can vary dramatically, so it's an interesting experiment. At first, I used the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P$ - Pikeman\n",
    "\n",
    "$A_B$ - coefficient for a pair $(A, B)$; how many $A$ is needed to match one $B$\n",

    "\n",
    "Some explanation: the higher $A_B$, the worse $A$'s chances in a duel with $B$. We want the unit value to behave the other way around, so we invert the results (hence the $^{-1}$). Inverted scores of $A$ are summed over each unit in $S$. To make those values meaningful, we need some point of reference, so we scale them in such a way, to make Pikeman's value always be 80 (equal to it's AI Value).\n",
    "\n",
    "After a while I thought of another way of calculating those values. Instead of comparing $A$ to a Pikeman only during normalization, we can do it for every unit in $S$ separately:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathrm{ValueAlt}(A, S) = \\dfrac{80}{\\left\\vert{S}\\right\\vert} \\sum\\limits_{s \\in S} \\dfrac{P_s}{A_s}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second formula behaves slightly different. To show that, let's consider this simple scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A  = Marksman\n",
    "    S0 = {Archer}\n",
    "    S  = {Archer, Archangel}\n",

    "    The table below shows combat results for Pikeman and Marksman against S.\n",

    "    Pikeman       1.575        64.529\n",
    "    Marksman\t  0.641        77.595\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Both formulas give the same result for a set with only one element. For example, \n",
    "    considering only Archer we get:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Value(A, S0) = ValueAlt(A, S0) = 1.575 / 0.641 * 80 ~= 196\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Now, let's add Archangel to the mix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Value(A, S)    = (1 / 0.641 + 1 / 77.595) / (1 / 1.575 + 1 / 64.529) * 80 ~= 193\n",
    "    ValueAlt(A, S) = (80 / 2) * (1.575 / 0.641 + 64.529 / 77.595)             ~= 131\n",
    "    \n",
    "The results differ quite a bit. Adding the Archangel (against which the performance of both Pikeman and Marksman is similarily poor), strongly decreased the Marksman's $\\mathrm{ValueAlt}$, while leaving its $\\mathrm{Value}$ almost untouched. Both behaviors make sense in their own way, and I am not sure which one I like better. I include the alternative version as a checkbox on site."

    "The calculated relative strength values are stable only for large stacks. For example, when Pikemen deal 700 damage, they kill 2 Archangels. When they deal 10 times more, they kill 28 Archangels, which is 14 times more. This leads to the situation where 8 Archangels almost always win against 520 Pikemen, but when you multiply both stack sizes by 10, suddenly the result is not far from 50-50. It's caused by the fact, that low amouts of damage have no effect on combat abilities of high-level units (the stack's efficiency stays the same until some units actually get killed). It means that for small stack sizes, calculated values are going to favor high-level units. You can of course run the simulator yourself to find the matching Pikemen stack for any number of Archangels.\n",
